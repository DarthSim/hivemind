# Hivemind

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DarthSim/hivemind.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DarthSim/hivemind)

Hivemind is a process manager for Procfile-based applications. At the moment, it supports Linux, FreeBSD, and macOS.

Procfile is a simple format to specify types of processes your application provides (such as web application server, background queue process, front-end builder) and commands to run those processes. It can significantly simplify process management for developers and is used by popular Platforms-as-a-Service, such as Heroku and Deis. You can learn more about the `Procfile` format [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/procfile) or [here](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/using_deis/process-types/).

There are some good Procfile-based process management tools, including [foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) by David Dollar, which started it all. The problem with most of those tools is that processes you want to manage start to think they are logging their output into a file, and that can lead to all sorts of problems: severe lagging, losing or breaking colored output. Tools can also add vanity information (unneeded timestamps in logs). Hivemind was created to fix those problems once and for all.

## Enter Hivemind

Hivemind uses `pty` to capture process output. That fixes any problem with log clipping, delays, and TTY colors other process management tools may have.

**If you would like a process management tool with a lot of features, including [tmux](https://tmux.github.io/) support, restarting and killing individual processes and advanced configuration, you should take a look at Hivemind's big brother â€” [Overmind](https://github.com/DarthSim/overmind)!**

## Installation

#### With Homebrew (macOS)

```bash
brew install hivemind
```

#### Download the latest Hivemind release binary

You can download the latest release [here](https://github.com/DarthSim/hivemind/releases/latest).

#### From Source

You need Go 1.5 or later to build the project.

```bash
$ go get -u -f github.com/DarthSim/hivemind
```
**Note:** You need to set `GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=1` to build hivemind with Go 1.5.

**Note:** You can update Hivemind the same way.

## Usage

Hivemind works with a `Procfile`. It may look like this:

```Procfile
web: bin/rails server
worker: bundle exec sidekiq
assets: gulp watch
```

To get started, you just need to run Hivemind from your working directory containing `Procfile`.

```bash
$ hivemind
```

If `Procfile` isn't located in your working directory, you can specify the path to it:

```bash
$ hivemind path/to/your/Procfile
```

Run `hivemind --help` to see other options.
